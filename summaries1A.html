Cyberspace consists of many (new) types of information. Information is related to, or described in terms of, ‘things’. Almost all these ‘things’ can be considered as resources. The organization of resources is of great importance, since it allows us to define those resources in such a way that they are accessible and usable in an efficient manner later on. According to Glushko (2013), there are five important questions that should be answered when it is about the organization of both tangible and intangible resources. These five questions are related to the what, why, how much, when and how or by whom. For example, one can consider whether it is preferred that a knowledge representation expert, a domain expert or a combination of both is responsible for the execution of the information organization.
Answers to those kind of questions are dependent of the specific context and problem. Every case of information organization requires a different set of measurements or decisions to solve the given problem and to make sure information is organized for the purposes of using it in later stages.

The information management strategies of volunteer management lead to the creation of homebrew databases. These databases are pieced together by volunteer coordinators to satisfy their information management needs and characterized by deficiencies in their appropriateness and usability.
Through interviews the researchers described characteristics of assemblages of information systems and related challenges. These interviews show that coordinators create homebrew databases according to some characteristics of their work context: the diversity and fluidity of information needs, of stakeholders and of work contexts as well as constrains in time, funding and expertise of the coordinators. As these factors are variable, the systems have to change as well. Partly because of this, homebrew databases are often distrusted across  numerous different systems which leads to overhead and version control issues. In some cases coordinators use personal office applications, which create problems related to scale and inaccessibility. The researches show that whatever type of system is used, each type has its own deficiencies.
The shortcomings motivate coordinators to find one system that can do everything. This refers to the prevalence of a recurrent cycle, based on recurrent attempts to satisfy needs by adapting the currently used system(s).

The article traces the history of efforts to enable Web-scale exchange of structured data and reports on Schema.org. Schema.org is created in 2011 with the idea to provide a single schema across a wide range of topics. It holds a set of vocabularies based on existing standard syntax, in wide-spread use today by both publishers and consumers of structured data on the Web. Applications of many different companies use Schema.org vocabulary. The adoption of important webmasters, like YouTube, IMDB and LinkedIn refer to the success of Schema.org. This success is linked in large part to the search engines and tools gathering behind it. The  design decisions underlying Schema.org’s enable webmasters to publish their data easily. Significant design decisions are for example related to syntax, polymorphism, entity references, incremental complexity and cleanup.
Schema.org partly relies on extensions. This allows topic experts to include specifications and collaborate with respect to certain domains and integrate their work with other areas. Therefore, Schema.org can be considered as the core, providing a standard vocabulary, as well as a place to create together. This fits the need to combine data from different sources and shared vocabularies to do so.
